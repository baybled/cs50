2017 CS50 course

This CS50 course was the second I followed along with, completing all of the problem sets. 

I have learnt:

Intemediary C
Intemediary Python
Intemediary SQL

Basic use of Flask
Basic JavaScript

Most enjoyable aspects:

  Learning about how to choose algorithms based on efficiency in order of (n).

  David J Malan's easy to follow macro to micro learning approach.
  
  Learning about BitMaps and JPGs in terms of data streams.

Things to change:

  Some of the projects which search strings can definitely be upgraded with better algorithms in the future. Possibly also a library.
